### Class 2

Howdy Front-Enders!

Today we:

- went over a few homeworks, and talked about how they were created
- looked at CSS syntax
	`attribute: <some string of text>;`
- copied our HTML and CSS to a folder on our Desktops called "Homework 2"
- created `index.html` and loaded it into Chrome
- recreated Joey's homework 1
- covered more HTML tags

Homework:

- download [this file](http://cl.ly/2b030w1C1Z3k/Homework%202.zip). It is a zip of my HTML at the end of the class, with all sorts of HTML tags, such as `form`, `pre`, `input`, `hr`, etc.
- Recreate your Homework 1 as an HTML file as discussed in lecture. You can use the `index.html` from my zip as a `boilerplate`, which has all the code from the end of lecture.
- Your previous "pens" are listed here if you need to find them: https://github.com/TIY-Houston-Q3-Front-End/Notes/issues/1
- Use the new tags discussed today, and continue playing with CSS properties on them.

	- `text-shadow` : http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_text_effects.asp
- When you are done, zip your files up like the following picture indicates: ![](http://cl.ly/image/1Q142C452Y0I/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-10%20at%201.33.19%20PM.png) and email them to me at [matt@theironyard.com](mailto:matt@theironyard.com).
