Homework:

Our homework is to create an HTML and CSS file for the [Surf N Paddle design](./class_4/surf-and-paddle.png). This homework will be due on Monday. Friday is reserved for working here at START, and asking questions.

I mentioned a few tools you can use:

- Screenshot tool (CMD + Shift + 4)
- Spotlight - to find programs - (CMD + Space)
- DigitalColor Meter - to get the colors on your screen (very handy!) (CMD + Space, then search "color meter") - this can help you get RGB colors from your design file (Surf N Paddle)
- [HSLPicker](http://hslpicker.com), to play with colors
