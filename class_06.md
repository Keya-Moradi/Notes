Howdy Front-Enders!

Today we:

- went over the homework content, and many examples
- talked about media queries, transitions, animations/keyframes, and built an [example project on them](./class_6/)

Resources:

- https://www.google.com/fonts
- http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/
- "Dingbats and Wingdings" - http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ and http://iconmelon.com/
- http://cubic-bezier.com/

Homework:

Our homework is to create a [mobile version of Surf N Paddle](./class_6//surf-and-paddle-responsive.pdf).

Start from scratch, think about clean code!

If you finish this afternoon, make this mobile version "responsive" â€“ use media queries to add columns to the content and make the site scale outwards to a larger size.

Use the resources above and these tools at your disposal:

- Screenshot tool (CMD + Shift + 4)
- Spotlight - to find programs - (CMD + Space)
- DigitalColor Meter - to get the colors on your screen (very handy!) (CMD + Space, then search "color meter") - this can help you get RGB colors from your design file (Surf N Paddle)
- [HSLPicker](http://hslpicker.com), to play with colors
