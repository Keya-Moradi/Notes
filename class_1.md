### Class 1!

Howdy students!

Today’s assignment is simple and tailored to help get you used to sharing code, writing some HTML, and creating from scratch.

With that, I’d like you to create a similar Codepen as listed below, and to use at least 10 different CSS properties to explore. You will find HTML tags and CSS properties listed on the w3schools links below.

Codepen from today: http://codepen.io/matthiasak/pen/jwrCv

When you have completed this, please post a link to your pen as a comment here: https://github.com/TIY-Houston-Q3-Front-End/Notes/issues/1

That's all!
