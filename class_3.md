### Class 2

Howdy Front-Enders!

Today we:

- went over a few homeworks, and talked about how they were created
- looked at more CSS syntax, and new attributes
- went through http://learnlayout.com and built our own blog layout
- covered CSS selectors, and more pseudo-classes
- talked about the CSS Point System, some responsive design (making sites work on desktops and mobile)

Homework:

- Link 1: Pseudo-classes! http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp
- Link 2: We made a blog layout today with a “display:fixed" nav. Read how to make this same layout with "display:inline-block”. http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html
- Link 3: Play around with this codepen: http://codepen.io/abergin/pen/jIplf. You can fork it and edit your own copy!
